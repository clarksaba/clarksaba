            <p>
                For this assignment, I wanted to construct a soccer ball by laser cutting cardboard shapes that were measured and modeled in 3D using Rhino.<br><br>
                Did I succeed? We'll see later this week after I visit the maker space.<br><br>
                But for now, let's talk about the modeling process.<br><br>

                After browsing a lot of press fit construction kits online, I was fascinated by the more circular designs and settled on creating a soccer ball.<br><br>
                The assignment required 30 instances of shapes, so I thought it was a nice fit (haha) that a soccer ball consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons for a total of 32 instances.<br><br>
                However... a challenge was that these pieces were being press fitted together at an angle.<br><br>
                To make sure the physical construction doesn't fall apart, I created multiple insertion slots on each side of every shape.<br>

            <p>
                One laser cutting batch contains 6 pentagons and 10 hexagons — half of the shapes needed to construct the ball.<br><br>
