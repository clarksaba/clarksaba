            <p>
                For this assignment, I wanted to construct a kit that formed curves using pentagons and hexagons. <br><br>I laser cut cardboard shapes that were measured and modeled in 3D using Rhino.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                The idea I had was inspired by a soccer ball which consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons pieced together. <br><br>
                A challenge with this concept was that it stretched the definition of "press fit" since the pieces would be pressed <br><br>
                together at an angle and not exactly at snug fits (but still secure enough not to fall apart when shaken).<br><br>
                <br><br>
                To help ensure the physical construction doesn't fall apart, I created multiple insert slots on each side of every shape. <br><br>
                The result would be a 3D puzzle of pentagons and hexagons.

            <p>
                I exported the shapes I modeled in Rhino into .ai files and created a batch for laser cutting that included <br><br>
                7 pentagons and 12 hexagons each on a 24inx18in board. Each outline had a 0.01 stroke for laser cutting.<br><br>

                III. Putting it altogether  ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
            </p></b>
            <p>
                I performed a test cut with 1 pentagon and 1 hexagon to see if they would piece together and it worked. Before I used the laser, <br><br>
                I measured the thickness of my cardboard with callipers so that I can apply the appropriate laser cutting settings: <br><br>

                Cardboard thickness: 4.07mm<br>
                Speed: 25%<br>
                Power: 50%<br>
                Frequency: 50%<br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/Laser cutter settings.jpg" width=400></img>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                I then did a few more test cuts to play around with different shape assemblies before committing to a full batch cut.
            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                Things looked good, so I placed a fresh 24inx18in cardboard into the machine and printed a batch.

                How hard can a 3d puzzle be? <small><small>(...pretty hard.)</small></small><br><br>
                At this point in the process I began to regret deviating a bit from the assignment expectations.<br><br>
                But, I was still happy that my pieces (mostly) fit together tightly and that I was able to create some fun shapes.<br><br>
