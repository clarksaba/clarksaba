            <p>
                For this assignment, I assembled and callibrated my 3D printer and printed basic shapes with different settings in Cura. <br>
                After experimenting with the various options, I designed a nested model in Rhino to slice and print.

               Assembling my Ender 3 Pro took around an hour and a half to complete. <br>
               <br>
               To properly align the bed, I followed the <a target="_blank" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EfWVUJjBdA>Bed Leveling
               Protocol</a> by Filament Friday. <br>
               <br>
               At first, my bed was too far from the extruder because I didn't own the tempered glass bed - <br>
               so I adjusted the z-switch to be lower, and then I adjusted the bed screws. Using a thin piece <br>
               of paper, I checked for resistance with the extruder at each corner and the center of the bed. <br>
               The following test print checks to see if the bed is properly leveled:

            <p><b>
                II. <u>Printing small basic shapes</u>
            </p></b>
            <p>
                To get comfortable with 3D printing, I started off with modeling (in Rhino) and slicing (with Cura) small basic shapes. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/basic-shapes-rhino.png" width="800"></img><br><br>
            <p>
                First, I modeled a 2cm cube in Rhino, exported it as a .stl file and then imported that into Cura. <br>
                I sliced three cubes at low quality, standard quality and super quality, then sliced another with a <br>
                concentric top and bottom. Respectively, these prints took 17, 22, 38 and 18 minutes. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/cura-cube.png" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/test-cubes.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                Then, I modeled and imported a 3cm diameter/height tube and experimented with wall thickness settings. <br>
                I sliced one tube with .4mm wall thickness and another with .8mm wall thickness. It's hard to notice these <br>
                differences in the physical prints, but the Cura preview reveals a clearer distinction in the layering of the wall.<br>
                Additionally, I changed the z-seam alignment on the double thickness tube from user specified to random. <br>
                I assume this is what causes the wall texture to appear spotty since the starting point in each layer is different. <br>
                <br>
                The cylinder with single extrusion wall thickness took 24 minutes to print and resulted in a height of 29.85mm <br>
                and a width of 29.91mm. The cylinder with double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment took <br>
                30 minutes to print and resulted in a height of 29.26mm and a width of 30.38mm.
            </p>
            <img src="img/cura-tubes.png" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/tubes.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                I moved onto cylinders that were also 3cm diameter/height. <br>
                <br>
                I exported the first cylinder from Rhino into an .stl file and specified a 0.1mm tolerance. <br>
                This slice lasted 27 minutes with a height of 30.06mm and a width of 29.69mm. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/cylinder1.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/Small tolerance.png" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                I exported the second cylinder and specified a 0.001mm tolerance. <br>
                This slice lasted 27 minutes with a height of 30.03mm and a width of 29.99mm. <br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/Smaller tolerance.png" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                For the third cylinder I specified the setting in Cura to spiralize the outer contour. <br>
                This slice lasted 22 minutes with a height of 30.26mm and a width of 29.45mm. <br>
                This setting has a faster print time because it only prints one wall with 0 infill. <br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/Spiralize.jpg" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                Lastly, I rotated a cylinder in Cura to be on its side and added support. <br>
                This slice lasted 25 minutes with a height of 29.5mm and a width of 29.7mm. <br>
                This cylinder in particular was a headache because laying it on its side meant the <br> 
                round walls were being extruded horizontally and thus were less precise.

            <p><b>
                III. <u>Modeling and printing nested parts</u>
            </p></b>
            <p>
                In Rhino, I created a series of rings out of extruded tubes that were then rotated and scaled down. <br>
                I went ahead and placed an eyeball in the middle that I found for free on an <a target="_blank" href=https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/eye-paulvandoorenmalen>.stl sharing website</a> <br>
                because the model started to remind me of a biblically accurate angel.
            </p>
            <img src="img/nested-artistic.png" width="500"></img>
            <img src="img/biblically-accurate-angel.jpg" width="300"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                The challenge was getting these rings to float altogether as a printed model and not fall apart. <br>
                I inserted these connectors between each ring by extruding and trimming small tubes. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/connector1.png" width="375"></img>
            <img src="img/connector2.png" width="425"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                Here's a completed Rhino model of the nested rings (and eyeball) with connectors holding it together. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/nested-sketch1.png" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/nested-sketch2.png" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                My first attempt at printing a V1 failed because I added way too much support in Cura which resulted in <br>
                an extremely long duration and a print that would not detach itself from the support. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/too-much-support.png" width="475"></img>
            <img src="img/ringsv1-1.jpg" width="325"></img><br>
            <p>
                I did manage to get these nested rings, but I wanted to keep experimenting with settings until I was successful.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/ringsv1-2.jpg" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                For V2, I rotated the model upright instead of laying it flat, and I removed the support. This drastically reduced <br>
                the print time to 25 minutes (but also because I scaled the model down because I was running out of PLA). <br>
                <br>
                Although the print came out in one piece and was held together, it was a mess of webs.
            </p>

            <img src="img/ringsv2-2.jpg" width="400"></img><br><br>

            <p>
                At this point I ran out of PLA, so I ordered more in black.<br>
                <br>
                For V3, I scaled the model up and printed in super quality.
            </p>
