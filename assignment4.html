            <p>
                For this assignment, I fabricated and constructed a physical box made up of flat panels <br>
                with sides that snap to each other using boxjoints and dogbones for a tight interference fit.<br>
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <p><b>
                I. <u>Testing out boxjoints</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
               I started off with designing and printing low quality boxjoints to test fit. <br>
               Through a process of trial-and-error, I considered the following test criteria: <br>
               <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Panel depth</b> — is the structure thick enough to snap without bending?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dogbone size</b> — do the insertion slots provide enough wiggle room?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Wall thickness</b> — are the edges thin enough to not interfere with the slots and dogbones?
                </li>
               </ol>
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/failed boxjoint tests.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                <u>Some testing observations:</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                At first, I extruded my panel curves to 1.5mm (nearly the same depth as the FR1 panels others were using for milling) <br>
                but I realized that size translates poorly to 3D printed PLA because its thinness causes it to bend and warp easily. <br>
                I doubled the extrusion for a <b>3mm panel depth</b>.
                <br><br>
                For dogbones, I started off with a radius of 0.4mm but realized these were too small and were unnoticeable. <br>
                I doubled the <b>dogbone size with a 0.8mm radius.</b>
                <br><br>
                Wall thickness was tricky because too much of it can get entangled with the dogbones and insertion slots, while <br>
                too little of it can cause the structure to collapse altogether (causing a few failed prints and wasted PLA). <br>
                I found a sweet spot for a <b>.4mm wall thickness and single wall line count.</b>
                <br><br>
                With these new settings, I created boxjoints that were tight when pressed together with just the right amount of wiggle room. <br>

                II. <u>Designing and printing flat panels</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I started off with a 40mm x 40mm square with two boxjoints on each side that were 10mm wide and 3mm deep with .8mm dogbones. <br>
                I designed around this initial square model with 60mm wide rectangle variations for the sides and top/bottom. <br>
                <br>
                I printed out the 2 squares and 2 rectangles that had a 40mm height, pieced them together, then measured the space between the <br>
                two pieced rectangles to determine the height of the other 2 rectangles to be pieced perpendicularly.

                III. <u>Constructing the box</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                After more testing and iterating through a few low quality prints to ensure that they'd piece together, <br>
                I printed out all flat panels in super quality and constructed the box. <br>
