            <h1>A7: Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <small><small>Last updated: Mon, Nov 21, 2022</small></small><br><br>


            <p>
                For my final project, I will create a custom chess set which includes a chess board <br>
                and 32 chess pieces. I plan to use the following digital fabrication techniques: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        3D modeling in Rhino and modifying meshes of sourced chess pieces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subtractive manufacturing to create panels with connector joints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Laser cutting wood panels to be stacked on top of each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Molding and casting individual pieces with high quality plaster.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            </p>
            
            <br><br>---<br><br>
            


            <p><b>
                I. <u>Concept fabrication & breakdown of tasks</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a moodboard of the chess set I plan to make:
            </p>
            <img src="img/chess set moodboard.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p> 
                For the exterior of the board, I will 3D print rectangular side panels and a square bottom surface <br>
                that are connected via boxjoints, and then I will sand the edges. <br>
                <br>
                For the interior, I will laser cut square sheets of wood to be stacked on top of each other to give <br>
                the board some depth and weight. I'm also considering leaving some space in the middle to add a metal <br>
                weight in case the stacked wood doesn't feel heavy enough.<br>
                <br>
                For the squares on top, I'm considering laser cutting wooden squares in two contrasting colors <br>
                and then gluing them together.
            </p>      
            <img src="img/chess board concept.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the chess pieces, I will iterate my work in the previous assignment and use molding and casting techniques. <br>
                I anticipate this to be the most time-consuming portion of the project because there's... a lot. <br>
                <br>
                In chess, there are 6 unique pieces and 32 pieces altogether. <br>
                There are 16 pawns, 4 knights, 4 bishops, 4 rooks, 2 queens, and 2 kings. <br>
                <br>
                After sourcing meshes of chess pieces online, I will design and 3D print molds of the 6 unique pieces. <br>
                Once each 3D printed mold is finished, I will sand the interior to ensure a smooth finish when casting silicone. <br>
                <br>
                When casting silicone, I'll use the leftover oomoo I have from the previous assignment. <br>
                I'm hopeful I'll have enough because I really don't want to spend another $40. <br>
                <br>
                Lastly, I will cast each individual piece in resin using the silicone molds. <br>
                This will be a looooong process because I need to account for 16 pawn pieces. <br>
                If I have even more leftover oomoo, I'll cast 2 seperate pawn molds out of silicone to make it go by faster. <br>

                II. <u>Timeline with contingency plans, & bill of materials with sourcing schedule</u></b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Contingencies: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the Mill's laser cutters are down, I will not include the wooden interior since that element <br>
                        is mostly just to provide depth and weight to the board. For the top squares however, this means <br>
                        I'd have to 3D print each square individually instead of laser cutting wood. This also means I'd <br>
                        have to print another surface for the pieces to sit flat on. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If molding and casting somehow fails, I might resort to 3D printing the pieces in resin at the Mill. <br>
                        I realize that casting resin also takes a long time, so I'm considering looking for a more lightweight material <br>
                        that cures quicker and isn't as expensive. If I don't finish my molds by next Tuesday, I will consider <br>
                        making the switch to 3D printing to just get pieces on the board, or maybe even create laser cut wood that are <br>
                        press fit together. Now that I'm typing this out, though, I kinda like this alternative more than molding and casting.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If I'm running low on any materials, I'm also considering scaling the set and pieces down in size to <br>
                        to create more of a handheld or portable set. Chess board dimensions typically float around 20x20 inches <br> 
                        (2.5x2.5 inch squares). To save on material and focus more on execution, I might scale it down to either <br>
                        12x12 inches or 8x8 inches.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If my 3D printer dies, I will be very sad! (and go to the Mill)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
