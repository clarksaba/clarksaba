            <small><small>Last updated: Tues, Nov 15, 2022</small></small><br><br>


            <p>
                For this assignment, I created pawns using meta-molding techniques.<br>
                <br>
                This was achieved by 3D printing a mold for an oomoo silicone mold, which <br>
                was then used to fill with hydrostone plaster to create identical pieces. <br>
                <br>
                I plan to make a chess set for my final project where the pieces are created <br>
                using molding techniques, so I found this project particularly useful (still challenging).

            <p><b>
                I. <u>Fabricating a 3D mold for an oomoo mold</u></b>
            </p>
            <p> 
                I searched on Thingiverse and downloaded a pawn stl to use for this project.<br>
                My process for 3D modeling the mold can be seen below. I may have overcomplicated <br>
                the process because for some reason I struggled to figure out how to create keys with depth. <br>
                <br>
                The main commands I used were:
            </p>          
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>MeshSplit</b> to cut the pawn piece in half using a planar surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Split, BooleanUnion</b> and <b>BooleanDifference</b> to subract and trim non-mesh <br>
                    surfaces and shape the mold box.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="img/Pawn 3d mold.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For my first failed print, I went with super quality and 0% infill (my mistake).<br>
                This is when I learned that Rhino doesn't fill in any non-mesh surfaces which <br>
                causes Cura to see those flat elevated surfaces as unprintable.
            </p>
            <img src="img/Cura error.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For my second print, I went with low quality and 20% infill to provide some <br>
                internal support for the elevated surface that the pawn would rest on. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/Cura pawn success.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                While the low quality print may have created some rough surfaces for the mold, <br>
                I decided to move forward anyway due to time constraints. <br>
                <br>
                When I repeat this process for my final project, I'll print in super quality. <br>

                II. <u>Creating a silicone mold with oomoo</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I mixed my oomoo silicone mixture and poured it into the printed molds.<br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/silicone4.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                After 6 hours, my silicone molds were done curing. I was surprised that the <br>
                rectangular keys I designed were a perfect fit since I saw many others were <br>
                using spheres for their keys. I secured the two molds together with rubber bands.<br>
            </p>

            <p><b>
                III. <u>Casting duplicate pawn pieces with hydrostone</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, I had instantly learned my lesson: an air vent for the plaster <br>
                would've been extremely useful and might've helped create less of a mess. <br>
                Because my molds were really small too, I struggled to effectively pour the <br>
                mixture into the mold. <br>
                <br>
                I continued to experiment with different hydrostone part mixtures to see the <br>
                differences it would create in the texture and quality of the casted pawn. <br>
                <br>
                For the first mixture, I used nearly equal parts water and powder. This resulted <br>
                in a brittle material that almost caused the pawn to crack in half. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/cracked pawn.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the following mixtures, I gradually decreased the amount of water for a thicker <br>
                mixture. These took less time to cure and yielded more solid pawns than before. <br>
                The first few pawns with more water were brittle and tended to crack easily. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/4 pawns.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                After these experiments, I will make the following adjustments for my final project: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Design air vents when creating the 3D printed mold.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slice the 3D printed mold in super quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use less water when casting with plaster.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
