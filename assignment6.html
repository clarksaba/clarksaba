            <p>
                For this assignment, I created pawns using meta-molding techniques.<br>
                <br>
                This was achieved by 3D printing a mold for an oomoo silicone mold, which <br>
                was then used to fill with hydrostone plaster to create identical pieces. <br>
                <br>
                I plan to make a chess set for my final project where the pieces are created <br>
                using molding techniques, so I found this project particularly useful (still challenging).

            </p>
            <p> 
                I searched on Thingiverse and downloaded a pawn stl to use for this project.<br>
                My process for 3D modeling the mold can be seen below. I may have overcomplicated <br>
                the process because for some reason I struggled to figure out how to create keys with depth. <br>
                <br>
                The main commands I used were:
            </p>          
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>MeshSplit</b> to cut the pawn piece in half using a planar surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Split, BooleanUnion</b> and <b>BooleanDifference</b> to subract and trim non-mesh <br>
                    surfaces and shape the mold box.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="img/Pawn 3d mold.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For my first failed print, I went with super quality and 0% infill (my mistake).<br>
                This is when I learned that Rhino doesn't fill in any non-mesh surfaces which <br>
                causes Cura to see those flat elevated surfaces as unprintable.
            </p>
            <img src="img/Cura error.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For my second print, I went with low quality and 20% infill to provide some <br>
                internal support for the elevated surface that the pawn would rest on. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/Cura pawn success.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                While the low quality print may have created some rough surfaces for the mold, <br>
                I decided to move forward anyway due to time constraints. <br>
                <br>
                When I repeat this process for my final project, I'll print in super quality. <br>
