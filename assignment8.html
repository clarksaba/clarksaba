            <p>
                For my final project, I used a combination of digital fabrication techniques to build a chess set including <br>
                the board and the pieces. The methods I used included: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Laser cutting, sanding and finishing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3D modeling and mesh editing in Rhino
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slicing and 3D printing in Cura
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing interference fits
                    </li>
                </ul>
                This plan slightly deviates from my proposal in that I originally intended to use molding and casting techniques <br>
                to create all of the chess pieces. I moved away from this method because of how much time and material it would cost <br>
                to cast 64 pieces total. Oomoo and resin is quite expensive and I'm a poor college student. <br>
                <br>
                My original plan also included subtractive manufacturing to construct the frame of the chess board, but I chose to <br>
                instead print the frame as one unit since I was downscaling the dimensions of the board anyway. Because I was creating <br>
                a mini-chess set, I added interference fits as one of my methods to cleanly press fit the pieces to the board. <br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p><b>
                I. <u>Conceptualizing the full chess set in Rhino</u></b>
            </p>
            <img src="img/Chess set full model.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                To start, I modeled the exterior frame which would later be 3D printed. The purpose of 3D printing the frame <br>
                is to carry the wooden interior and provide a bevel accent that might not be easily achievable with laser cutting. <br>
                <br>
                BooleanUnion helped me combine walls that were 3.5mm thick, and a base that was 1mm thick. To create the bevel <br>
                near the top, I BooleanDifference'd large cylinders to subtract edges from the walls. <br>
                <br>
                The height of the frame was determined by the 1/8in laser cut wood panels I planned to insert inside. <br>
                A 17.5mm height provided room for a 1mm base, 5 layers of 3.2mm wood, and wiggle room for glue between layers.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/bevel-before.png" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/bevel-after.png" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                The purpose of laser cutting wood for the interior and the top squares was to explore woodworking via digital fabrication. <br>
                Also, 3D printing panels takes a long time, so laser cutting wood was always the more time-efficient alternative. <br>
                I modeled how 5 layers of 1/8in wood look when stacked and glued together. <br>
                <br>
                Because my chess frame design would be much smaller than a traditional chess board, I imagined so many moving <br> 
                pieces on a small surface might be messy. Therefore, I designed the top squares with small holes (3mm diameter) <br>
                and modified chess piece meshes to include ~2.95mm pegs at their bases so that they can be press-fit together. <br>

                II. <u>Laser cutting the wood interior</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I acquired two large sheets of 1/8in wood in contrasting colors — birch and hardboard. I had originally hoped to <br>
                use maple and walnut, but I couldn't source the materials in time for this project deadline so I worked with what <br>
                I could immediately find at the art store. <br>
                <br>
                I exported the outlines from Rhino to Illustrator and laid them out on an artboard.
            </p>
            <img src="img/lasercuttingwood.jpg" width="600"></img><br>
            <p>
                When experimenting with laser cutter settings, I stuck with 100 power and 40 frequency. <br>
                Starting at around 20 speed, I gradually lowered it until the laser pierced the wood. <br>
                <br>
                The birch wood required a speed of 10, and the hardboard wood required a speed of 5.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/woodcuttingsettings2.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/woodcuttingsettings1.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                After the first successful laser cut, I repeated the print job on the leftover space to create the interior <br>
                wood panels and extra top squares if needed. In total, the top surface would only need 32 squares of each color. <br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/unsanded-unglued-wood.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                I tightly glued the wood layers and squares together. I then sanded the squares to get rid of the burn marks from <br> 
                the laser and create a smooth even surface. After a little cleaning, I finished the surface by rubbing mineral oil.

            <p><b>
                III. <u>3D printing the exterior frame</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Before 3D printing the frame, I worked concurrently with the wood interior assembly to create rapid prototypes of <br>
                walls that allowed the interior to be smoothly inserted. I knew that I had to experiment with tolerances and slight <br>
                resizing to get the pieces to fit together– not too tight or too loose.<br>
                <br>
                I created these rapid prototypes by vertically splitting the frame after resizing the walls.
            </p>

            <img src="img/frameprototype2.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                After messing with tolerances and adjusting the size millimeter by millimeter, I got the measurements just right. <br>
                I also had to rescale my original model to fit within the boundaries of the Ender 3 Pro– nearly pushing its boundaries.
            </p>
            <img src="img/chess-frame-in-cura.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                19 hours later, the print finished and satifyingly fit the wood interior.

            <p><b>
                IV. <u>Modifying chess piece meshes, and testing interference fits</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I sourced .stl meshes of chess pieces from Thingiverse and modified them to fit the dimensions of my particular board. <br>
                <br>
                These modifications included scaling down the dimensions of the pieces and using ReduceMesh to simplify the polygons <br>
                from ~300,000 per piece to 3,000 polygons maximum so that the meshes would be easier to work with and output less lag. <br>
                <br>
                Another modification was MeshBooleanUnion-ing ~2.95mm cylinder pegs at the base of each piece so that they could be <br>
                press fitted into the 3mm diameter holes that were laser cut across the square surfaces.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/modeling-the-peg.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/reduce-pawn-mesh.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                One major challenge I came across was figuring out what orientation to print each piece in. <br>
                <br>
                Because I added a peg under each piece, printing the pieces upright would be unstable without proper support, <br>
                but the support often interfered with the peg itself and created inconsistent measurements for the pegs. <br>
                Printing pieces on the side had similar effects.<br>
                <br>
                Printing pieces upside down with tree supports surprisingly yielded the most successful result with the <br>
                most consistently clean and precise pegs.

            <img src="img/slice-upsidedown.jpg" width="266"></img><br>
            <p>
                Bonus: a failed bulk print. I believe this was because some pieces like knights and bishops didn't automatically generate <br>
                proper supports. I proceeded by printing each piece individually and manually adding tree supports whenever needed. <br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/failed-print.jpeg" width="400"></img><br>
            <p>
                It took a couple attempts and resizing to get the pegs properly press-fitted into the holes.
