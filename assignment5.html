            <small><small>Last updated: Tues, Nov 8, 2022</small></small><br><br>


            <p>
                For this assignment, I practiced combining, checking and repairing meshes to <br>
                produce a single printable STL that passes checks for rapid prototyping.<br>
                <br>
                I also ideated a lamp using digital fabrication techniques I've learned thus far. <br>
            </p>

            <p><b>
                I. <u>Practicing with Meshes</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>               
                When working with meshes, I kept the following in mind:
               <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Polygon complexity</b> — is there an appropriate amount of polygons in the mesh <br>
                    that keeps it lightweight yet detailed?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Intersections and holes</b> — are the meshes closed with no naked edges?
                </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I searched the web for existing STLs to play around with, and I thought it would be fun <br>
                to attempt to replicate the look of this character from a video game I had just started. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/Higgs.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I found an STL of a human face as well as an STL of a replica of the character's mouthpiece. <br>
                I love how absolutely cursed these meshes look. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/original face stl.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/original mask stl.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I did some initial checks with each mesh using the Rhino command <i>MeshRepair.</i> <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a good face mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, the mesh of the face was "a good mesh", but I anticipated the high <br>
                polygon complexity would make it a little difficult to work with so I repeatedly used <br>
                the command <i>ReduceMesh</i> to simplify the faces from 40,500 to 10,000. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I then checked the mesh of the mouthpiece which was so complex it made my computer slow. <br>
                <i>MeshRepair</i> indicated that the mesh was bad because it had many pairs of faces that intersect each other. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a bad mask mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                To fix this, I drastically reduced the mesh faces from 719,344 to 1,216. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a good mask mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                With some additional scaling and stretching, I was able to piece these two good meshes together. <br>
                I also used the command <i>PointsOn</i> to select and move vertices and further connect the two meshes. <br>
                I then used the command <i>MeshBooleanUnion</i> to join the face and the mouthpiece into one closed mesh. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/mesh with points on.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/rendered mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I exported the mesh as an STL file, then imported it into Cura to test its printing capabilities. <br>
                With supports it's crying, just like me when I come home to failed prints. <br>
            </p>

            <img src="img/mesh with supports in cura.png" width="200"></img><br>

                II. <u>Designing a Lamp</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeking inspiration for lamp designs online, I got sucked into the voronoi rabbit hole. <br>
                I liked how organic and alien it looked. <br>

                Here are is a voronoi moodboard for inspiration: <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/trypophobia.jpg" width="800"></img>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Before attempting something complicated like a human sculpture, I first wanted to study the basics <br>
                of voronoi 3D modeling and start with something in the shape of a vase with a light fixture near the bottom. <br>
                <br>
                I learned that voronoi is mostly created using parametric modeling so I hopped back into Grasshopper. <br>
                To be honest, Grasshopper still confuses the hell out of me, and I was only able to create these dynamic <br>
                shapes thanks to some tutorials I found online (sources listed at the end of this writeup).<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/voronoi base layer in grasshopper.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/voronoi base layer baked.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/mounting idea 1.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I played around with different voronoi parameters to fit the measurements of my bulb. <br>
                The bulb I used curved wider towards the top at around 60mm diameter, while the body of the innered <br>
                was mostly around 37mm diameter.
            </p>
            <img src="img/hue bulb.jpg" width="400"></img>
            <img src="img/innered measurement.jpg" width="400"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I had this idea to have a hanging light design where the wider part of the bulb sustained the voronoi shell <br>
                near its open lid by having the diameter of the open lid be a few mm less than the widest part of the bulb. <br>
                Meanwhile, I would fabricate a hole towards the base of the shell where I could insert the innered through <br>
                to connect to the bulb. <br>
        
            </p>
            <img src="img/Voronoi rhino.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/Voronoi STL.jpg" width="800"></img>
            <img src="img/Voronoi Vase.jpg" width="800"></img>
            <img src="img/Voronoi Lamp.jpg" width="800"></img>
            <p>
                Looking back, I don't think the idea I had in my head was executed as well as I hoped. If I were to do another <br>
                variation of a voronoi lamp, I'd secure the bulb near the base with the covered surfaces, which might have a <br>
                more prominent shadow effect when placed near a wall. After this assignment, I do wish I practiced more with <br>
                a simpler design and focused more on ways to secure the lamp upright instead of creating a shell for a hanging bulb. <br>
            </p>
