            <h1>A5: Getting Meshy, and Lamps</h1>
            <small><small>Last updated: Tues, Nov 8, 2022</small></small><br><br>


            <p>
                For this assignment, I practiced combining, checking and repairing meshes to <br>
                produce a single printable STL that passes checks for rapid prototyping.<br>
                <br>
                I also ideated a lamp using digital fabrication techniques I've learned thus far. <br>
            </p>

            <p><b>
                I. <u>Practicing with Meshes</u></b>
            </p>
            <p>               
                When working with meshes, I kept the following in mind:
               <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Polygon complexity</b> — is there an appropriate amount of polygons in the mesh <br>
                    that keeps it lightweight yet detailed?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Intersections and holes</b> — are the meshes closed with no naked edges?
                </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I searched the web for existing STLs to play around with, and I thought it would be fun <br>
                to attempt to replicate the look of this character from a video game I had just started. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/Higgs.jpg" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I found an STL of a human face as well as an STL of a replica of the character's mouthpiece. <br>
                I love how absolutely cursed these meshes look. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/original face stl.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/original mask stl.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I did some initial checks with each mesh using the Rhino command <i>MeshRepair.</i> <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a good face mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, the mesh of the face was "a good mesh", but I anticipated the high <br>
                polygon complexity would make it a little difficult to work with so I repeatedly used <br>
                the command <i>ReduceMesh</i> to simplify the faces from 40,500 to 10,000. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I then checked the mesh of the mouthpiece which was so complex it made my computer slow. <br>
                <i>MeshRepair</i> indicated that the mesh was bad because it had many pairs of faces that intersect each other. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a bad mask mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                To fix this, I drastically reduced the mesh faces from 719,344 to 1,216. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/this is a good mask mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <p>
                With some additional scaling and stretching, I was able to piece these two good meshes together. <br>
                I also used the command <i>PointsOn</i> to select and move vertices to further connect the two meshes. <br>
                I then used the command <i>MeshBooleanUnion</i> to join the face and the mouthpiece into one closed mesh. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/mesh with points on.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <img src="img/rendered mesh.png" width="800"></img><br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I exported the mesh as an STL file, then imported it into Cura to test its printing capabilities. <br>
                With supports, it's crying. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/mesh in cura.png" width="600"></img>
            <img src="img/mesh with supports in cura.png" width="200"></img><br>
